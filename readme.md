# Problem Statement
By use of various tools and techniques we have to create a website or application on which we can analyze data for various stock markets, not just the Indian Stock Market. And also can upload custom MS Excel sheets of data and analyze the data and also can download the data in form of an Excel sheet. There should also be predictions based on data that how the market will perform in the future.

To deploy the model first download zip file of this repository\
Install streamlit on your system\


Fullfill the requirements by installing liberaries:\

tensorflow==2.9.1\
tensorflow-estimator==2.9.0\
tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem==0.26.0\
yfinance==0.1.74\
sklearn==0.0\

Than run command prompt on the unzipped folder
then run code:
